SQL Query: SELECT p.product_name, b.brand_name, c.category_name FROM products p JOIN brands b ON p.brand_id = b.brand_id JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id LIMIT 5
Answer: The query to list all product names together with their brand name and category name is:

```sql
SELECT p.product_name, b.brand_name, c.category_name 
FROM products p 
JOIN brands b ON p.brand_id = b.brand_id 
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id 
LIMIT 5;
```

This query joins the `products`, `brands`, and `categories` tables based on their respective IDs and returns the product name, brand name, and category name for each product, limited to 5 results. 

The result of the query is:

```python
